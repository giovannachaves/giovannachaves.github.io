My main fields of interest are applied microeconomics, development economics and public policy, with a focus on economics of education and labor. \r\n\r\nI graduated from Minerva University in 2020, where I had the opportunity to study and live in seven different countries, collaborating with numerous organizations in the process. My understanding of economics was greatly inspired by this international experience, as was my proficiency in navigating metro systems.\r\n\r\nYou can contact me at gchaves at uni.minerva.edu.","note":"Don't delete this file!
