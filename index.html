<p> Ol√°! My name is Giovanna Chaves and I am currently a Research Fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank. My main fields of interest are applied microeconomics, development economics and public policy, with a focus on human capital accumulation and the role of technology in education and labor. </p>
<p> I received my MSc from the Barcelona School of Economics and my BSc from Minerva University, where I had the opportunity to study and live in seven different countries, collaborating with numerous organizations in the process. My understanding of economics was greatly inspired by this international experience, as was my proficiency in efficiently navigating metro systems worldwide.</p>
<p>You can contact me at gchaves(at)uni(dot)minerva(dot)edu.</p>
