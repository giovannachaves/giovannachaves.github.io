<p> Olá! I am currently a first-year PhD Student in Economics at NYU. My main fields of interest are applied microeconomics, labor economics and development, with a focus on human capital accumulation and the role of technology in education and labor. </p>
<p> Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank. I received my MSc from the Barcelona School of Economics and my BSc from Minerva University, where I had the opportunity to study and live in seven different countries. My understanding of economics was greatly inspired by this international experience, as was my proficiency in efficiently navigating metro systems worldwide.</p>
